Check the extracted values to confirm they are correct. If you find an extracted value that is not correct, click the pencil button to start making a correction. For array fields, you can double click on the cell that needs correcting

Replace the value with the correct value and then click the checkmark button to update the value. If there shouldn’t be a value, click the circled x button to set the value to `null`.

Once you’ve made all the necessary corrections, click “Save and approve”. A dialog will appear asking you to explain your corrections.

These explanations are used to improve the extraction accuracy so it is important that you clearly and concisely explain what was wrong, what is right, and how you know.
Once finished, click “Confirm corrections” and you are done! The workflow run will be updated with the new values.
