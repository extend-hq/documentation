From the processor UI in Studio, you can publish new versions of your processor, which can then be selected and used in one or more workflows deployed on Extend.

When you save changes to a processor, these will update the draft version. You can make as many changes as you want
before publishing a new version, and once you do, all the changes will be rolled into the new version and the draft will go back
to having no "Unpublished changes".

## Minor version

When you are making only a change in description (e.g. a field or classification prompt change), it is recommended that you publish a minor version. 
A minor version change implies it will not affect the existing workflows that are using the processor and how data is sent to downstream consumers.

To publish a minor version, click on the "Publish" button and select the "Minor" radio option:

## Major version

When you are making a change in the configuration of the processor that would affect the shape of data sent to downstream consumers or how the processor would
interact with a workflow, it is recommended that you publish a major version.

To publish a major version, click on the "Publish" button and select the "Major" radio option:

## Viewing published versions

Once a version is pubished, it cannot be updated and will only be viewable in a read-only mode.

You can select a published version to view its details and see the configuration that was used to create it from the processor Overview tab:
