description: "How to leverage bounding box references when reviewing documents in Extend."
---

While traditional OCR products will often include a bounding box reference, Extend uses a mix of large language models and foundation vision models in order to build our AI 
powered document processing, and because of this including bounding box references is not always possible. However, we are actively iterating on methods to 
provide bounding box visual aids that to enhance the native review experience.

Though the experience is still in BETA, bounding box references are available both in our product and via API. 

While in beta, the following these field types are most limited:
- `date` fields - These are currently less reliable than other field types, and may not always be returned.
- `string` fields - When extracting values that are mostly **interpretation** based, bounding boxes will be less reliable.
- `boolean` fields - These are currently not supported for bounding box references.
- `null` fields - If a field is not found or unable to be extracted, no bounding boxes will be returned.

Right now bounding box references are only available for `Extraction` output fields, and are only supported for the following file/document types:
- `PDF`
- `IMG` (jpeg, png, etc)

## Demo

When reviewing, as you use your arrow keys to navigate through each review field, our file viewer will automatically scroll
to the relevant page, and if a bounding box reference was made available in our system, it will be highlighted for you to serve as visual aid
when review.

To disable the bounding box experience you can toggle the beta option off in the Custom Settings of a given extraction config.
Once you have the settings open, scroll to the bottom and toggle this button off, then hit save:
