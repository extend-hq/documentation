Formulas are special expressions that can reference fields from workflow steps and use functions to manipulate data and calculate values.
They are used in Validation steps to define validation rules.

## Examples

| Formula | Description |
| - | - |
| `ISPRESENT(extraction1.address)` | Verify that an address has been extracted |
| `extraction1.amount = extraction1.price * extraction1.quantity + extraction1.tax` | Verify that the total amount is calculated correctly |
| `IF(classification1 = "invoice", extraction1.invoice_date, extraction2.due_date)` | If the document is an invoice, then get the invoice date, otherwise get the due date |

## Variables

A variable is simply a reference to a workflow data field. They can be outputs of document processor steps or fields retrieved from your system using External Data Validation steps.

### Classification

For Classification steps, the variable is the step name, e.g. `classification1`.
The type of the variable will be `text` and its value will be the file's classification type.

### Extraction

For Extraction steps, the variable is the step name joined with the field name, e.g. `extraction1.address` or `extraction2.line_items.quantity` (for nested object or array fields).
The type of the variable will match the type of the extraction field.
For subfields of an array, the type will be an array of the subfield's type.
The value may be `NULL` if the field could not be extracted.

### External Data Validation

For External Data Validation steps, the variable is the step name joined with the field path of the returned payload, `external1.path.to.field`.

<Warning>
  It is your responsibility to ensure that External Data Validation variables are populated and have the correct types.
  For example, to use array variables you must return an object of arrays instead of an array of objects.

## Data types

All formulas values, including input variables, formula constants, and function outputs belong to one of the following data types.

| Type | Description |
| - | - |
| `boolean` | A `TRUE` or `FALSE` value |
| `number` | A 64bit floating number |
| `text` | A string of arbitrary length |
| `date` | A date without a time of day or time zone |
| `currency` | A monetary value containing a `number` amount and a ISO 4217 currency code |
| `array<T>` | An array of the non-array type `T`. Mixed type arrays are not permitted. |

### Collection types

The `currency` and `array` types represent collections over one of the other primitive types and can be used wherever their underlying primitive type can be used.
For example, the `currency` type's primitive type is `number`, so it can be used in numerical operations like addition or multiplication with other `number` or `currency` values.
So can an array of numbers, but not an array of texts.

Note that when an operation or a function uses both collection and primitive types, then the output will usually, but not always, belong to the collection type.
For example, adding a `currency` and a `number` produces a `currency`, but comparing them will produce a `boolean` instead.

### Nulls

Values of any type can also be `NULL` which represents the absence of a value.
Generally, null values will be treated as zero values of their type (e.g. `0` or `FALSE` or `""`) when used in an operation or function.
Use the `ISPRESENT`, `ISBLANK`, or `IFNULL` functions to explicitly check for and handle nulls.

## Operations

The below table shows all the operations in their order of operations (from lowest to highest).
An operation with a higher order of operation will take precedence over a lower one.

| Operation | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `a = b` | `boolean` | `a` is equal to `b` |
| `a <> b` | `boolean` | `a` is not equal to `b` |
| `a < b` | `boolean` | `a` is less than `b` |
| `a <= b` | `boolean` | `a` is less or equal to `b` |
| `a > b` | `boolean` | `a` is greater than `b` |
| `a >= b` | `boolean` | `a` is greater than or equal to `b` |
| `a + b` | `number` | `a` plus `b` |
| `a - b` | `number` | `a` substract `b` |
| `s & t` | `text` | `s` concatenate `t` |
| `a * b` | `number` | `a` multipled by `b` |
| `a / b` | `number` | `a` divided by `b` |
| `a ^ b` | `number` | `a` raised to the power of `b` |
| `-a` | `number` | Negative `a` |
| `( ... )` | `T` | Parentheses |
| `FUNC( ... )` | `T` | Function call |

## Functions

This is the list of all functions, their return types, and their behavior.
Please reach out to us if there are functions not included here that would be helpful to you!

| Formula | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `ISPRESENT(arg: T)` | `boolean` | Returns whether or not the argument is not `NULL`. |
| `ISBLANK(arg: T)` | `boolean` | Returns whether or not the argument is `NULL`. |
| `IF(condition: boolean, ifTrue: T, ifFalse: T)` | `T` | Returns the value of `ifTrue` if `condition` is `TRUE`, returns the value of `ifFalse` otherwise. |
| `IFNULL(arg: T, ifNull: T)` | `T` | Returns the value of `arg` if it is not `NULL`, returns the value of `ifNull` otherwise. |
| `AND(arg: boolean, ...)` | `boolean` | Returns `TRUE` if all the arguments are `TRUE`, returns `FALSE` otherwise. |
| `OR(arg: boolean, ...)` | `boolean` | Returns `TRUE` if any of the arguments are `TRUE`, returns `FALSE` otherwise. |
| `NOT(arg: boolean)` | `boolean` | Returns `TRUE` if the argument is falsey (e.g. `FALSE`, `0`, `""`, `NULL`), returns `FALSE` otherwise. |
| `DATE(arg: text)` | `date` | Converts the given text into a `date` value. |

## Constants

Formulas may include constant values such as numbers (e.g. `0`, `12.50`, `-100`), texts (e.g. `"hello!"`, `""`), or booleans (`TRUE` or `FALSE`) only.
To declare a constant date, use the `DATE` function (e.g. `DATE("2024-01-01")`).

To include double quotation marks in a text constant, escape it with a backslack `\"`, e.g. `"She said \"Hi!\""`.
