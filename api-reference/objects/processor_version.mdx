title: "The ProcessorVersion object"
---

The ProcessorVersion object represents a specific version of a document processor in Extend. It contains detailed information about a particular iteration of a processor, including its processor configuration and version string.

The versions are semantic versions supporting only major/minor, and if no published versions exist, there is always a `draft` version.
