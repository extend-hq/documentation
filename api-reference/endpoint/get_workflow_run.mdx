# Output Types

**Note**: The output objects shown in the payload above will conform to the following schema, and the field keys are defined when configuring the extractor/classifer
in your worklfow builder:

```typescript Output types
/* The output type when type=EXTRACT */
export interface ExtractionOutput {
  [key: string]: ExtractFieldResult;
}

export interface ExtractorFieldInput {
  fieldName: string;
  description: string;
  type:
    | "string"
    | "number"
    | "currency"
    | "boolean"
    | "date"
    | "any[]"
    | "object";
  schema?: ExtractorFieldInput[];
}

export interface ExtractionFieldResult {
  id: string;
  value: string;
  confidence: number;
  type:
    | "string"
    | "number"
    | "currency"
    | "boolean"
    | "date"
    | "array"
    | "object"
    | "null";
  schema?: ExtractorFieldInput[]; // Only set when type=array or type=object to provide structure of sub fields
}

/* The output type when type=CLASSIFY */
export type ClassificationOutput = {
  type: string;
  confidence: number;
};

export type Classification = {
  type: string;
  description: string;
};
```
