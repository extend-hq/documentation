title: "List Processor Versions"
api: "GET https://api-prod.extend.app/v1/processors/:id/versions"
description: "Retrieve all versions of a specific processor in Extend."
---

This endpoint allows you to fetch all versions of a given processor, including the current `draft` version.

- Versions are typically returned in descending order of creation (newest first), but this should be confirmed in the actual implementation.
- The `draft` version is the latest unpublished version of the processor, which can be published to create a new version. It might not have any changes from the last published version.
