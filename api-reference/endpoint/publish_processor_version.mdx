title: "Publish Processor Version"
api: "POST https://api-prod.extend.app/v1/processors/:id/publish"
description: "Publish a new version of an existing processor in Extend."
---

This endpoint allows you to publish a new version of an existing processor. Publishing a new version creates a snapshot of the processor's current configuration and makes it available for use in workflows.
Publishing a new version does not automatically update existing workflows using this processor. You may need to manually update workflows to use the new version if desired.

### Path Parameters

<ParamField path="id" type="string" required>
  The ID of the processor to publish a new version for.
</ParamField>

### Body

<ParamField body="releaseType" type="string" required>
  The type of release for this version. The two options are: "major" and "minor", which will increment the version number accordingly.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="description" type="string">
  A description of the changes in this version. This helps track the evolution of the processor over time.
</ParamField>

{/* NOTE: while we do support this - I actually do not want to publicize it until we get a request for it, as we would prefer customers use our UI - potentially in the future we will just remove support entirely */}
{/* <ParamField body="config" type="object" optional>
  Optionally supply a config object for this version of the processor. 
  
  If not supplied, the config that is currently in the `draft` ProcessorVersion in Extend will be used.

  The structure of this object will depend on the type of processor and its specific requirements.
</ParamField> */}

### Response

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean">
  A true or false value indicating whether the processor version was published successfully or not.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="processorVersion" type="ProcessorVersion">
  A ProcessorVersion object representing the newly published version of the processor. See the [ProcessorVersion object](/api-reference/objects/processor_version) for more details.
</ResponseField>

### Error Responses

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean">
  Will be `false` if the request failed.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="error" type="string">
  A description of the error that occurred.
</ResponseField>
