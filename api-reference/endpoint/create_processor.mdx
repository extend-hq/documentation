</ParamField>

<ParamField body="type" type="string" required>
  The type of the processor.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="cloneProcessorId" type="string">
  The ID of an existing processor to clone. If provided, a new processor will be created that clones the config of this processor.
</ParamField>

### Response

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean">
  A true or false value indicating whether the processor was created successfully or not.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="processor" type="DocumentProcessor">
  A Processor object representing the newly created processor. See the [DocumentProcessor object](/api-reference/objects/processor) for more details.
</ResponseField>

### Error Responses

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean">
  Will be `false` if the request failed.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="error" type="string">
  A description of the error that occurred.
</ResponseField>
