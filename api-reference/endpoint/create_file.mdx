Creating a new File is a pre requesite for using that file with the evaluation sets API. 

This endpoint will pre-process the contents of the file, and store it in the Extend platform for use in evaluation sets. If the file is not one of our supported types, the endpoint will throw an error. A small amount of latency (2-3 seconds) is expected for this endpoint as the file is processed and stored.

</ResponseField>
