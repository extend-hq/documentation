title: "Correct WorkflowRun Outputs"
api: "POST https://api-prod.extend.app/v1/workflow_runs/:workflowRunId/outputs/:outputId"
description: "Use this endpoint to submit corrected outputs for a WorkflowRun for future processor evaluation and tuning in Extend."
---

If you are using our Human-in-the-loop workflow review, then we already will be collecting your operator submitted corrections. However,
if you are receiving data via the API without human review, there could be incorrect outputs that you would like to correct for future usage in evaluation and tuning within
the Extend platform. This endpoint allows you to submit corrected outputs for a WorkflowRun, by providing the correct output for a given output ID.

The output ID, would be found in a given entry within the `outputs` arrays of a [WorkflowRun payload](/api-reference/objects/workflow_run).
The ID would look something like `dpr_gwkZZNRrPgkjcq0y-***`.

When using this endpoint, you will need to provide both the run id and the ouput id as parameters, and the corrected `reviewedOutput` as the body of the request. See below for more details.

### Parameters

<ParamField path="workflowRunId" type="string">
  The ID of the WorkflowRun that incldued this initial output.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="outputId" type="string">
  The ID of the output that these corrections are for.
</ParamField>

### Body

<ParamField body="reviewedOutput" type="object" required>
  The corrected output of the processor when run against the file. 
  
  This should be a JSON object conforming to the [output type schema](/api-reference/guides/output_types) of the given processor.

  If this is an extraction result, you can include all fields, or just the ones that were corrected, our system will handle merges/dedupes. However, if you do include a field, we assume the value incldued in the final reviewed value.
</ParamField>
