Evaluation sets are a collection of files and expected outputs that are used to evaluate the performance of a given processor in Extend. 
This endpoint will create a new evaluation set in Extend, which items can be added to using the [Create Evaluation Set item](/api-reference/endpoint/add_to_eval_set) endpoint.

*Note:* it is not necessary to create an evaluation set via API. You can also create an evaluation set via the Extend dashboard and take the ID from there:
