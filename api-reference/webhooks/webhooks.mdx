The Extend Platform has support for webhooks. Once a WorkflowRun has been "PROCESSED", the output will be sent to the Webhook URL that has been configured.

Example Output:
```json Response
{
  "eventId": "event_1234",
  "eventType": "workflow_run.completed",
  "payload": {
    "object": "workflow_run",
    "id": "workflow_run_1234",
    "status": "PROCESSED",
    "metadata": {
      "is_important": true,
    },
    "fileName": "example_file_name",
    "extractionOutput": {
      "name": "John Smith",
      "birthday": "January 1, 1970",
      "favoriteColor": "blue"
    },
    "initialRunBy": "test@test.com",
    "initialRunAt": "2023-01-01T09:41:00.000Z",
    "reviewedOutput": null,
    "reviewedAt": null,
    "startTime": "2023-01-01T09:41:00.000Z",
    "endTime": "2023-01-01T09:43:00.000Z",
    "workflow": {
      "id": "workflow_1234",
      "name": "employees",
    }
  }
}
```

To set up a webhook, please reach out to an Extend team member with the URL of the webhook where you'd like the output to be sent and the Workflow this should be applied to.
