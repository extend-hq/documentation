## Authenticating webhooks

To authenticate an incoming webhook event you can check the `extend-signature` header on the request and match it against the webhook secret
available in your Extend dashboard settings. If the `extend-signature` header value does not match your secret, you should toss out the incoming event.

## The webhook event

### Fields

| Field     | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| eventId   | **string** - Unique identifier for the event                                                                                                                    |
| eventType | **string** - Type of the event that occurred (workflow_run.completed)                                                                                           |
| payload   | **object** - Contains the data related to the event. In this case, it includes the properties of a completed workflow run from the IPublicWorkflowRun interface |

Here is what you can expect for a given incoming event:

```json Event
{
  "eventId": "event_jfdkfjsek",
  "eventType": "e.g. workflow.created, workflow_run.completed",
  "payload": {
    "object": "workflow_run",
    "id": "wr_fhdsjkfd"
    // etc.
  }
}
```

## List of all event types

The following table outlines the various event types you can receive via webhooks:

| Event Type                | Description                                     |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| workflow_run.completed    | Triggered whenever a WorkflowRun is completed   |
| workflow_run.failed       | Triggered whenever a WorkflowRun fails          |
| workflow_run.needs_review | Triggered whenever a WorkflowRun needs review\* |
| workflow.created          | Triggered whenever a new Workflow is created    |

\*Only triggered when the workflow is configured to have a HumanReview step in the Extend workflow builder

## Example: `workflow_run.completed`

Once a workflow run is completed, if your workflow is configured to send a webhook, a `workflow_run.completed` event
will be pushed to your system, assuming you have defined a webhook url in your dashboard. Please reach out if you require any help
getting set up.

For details on the shape of different run output types (e.g. Extraction, Classification, etc) see

To set up a webhook, you can add a webhook url in the Extend dashboard settings. Once you have done this, you will start receiving events for workflow runs.
