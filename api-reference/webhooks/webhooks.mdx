## Authenticating webhooks

To authenticate an incoming webhook event you can check the `extend-signature` header on the request and match it against the webhook secret
available in your Extend dashboard settings. If the `extend-signature` header value does not match your secret, you should toss out the incoming event.

## Setting up a webhook
To set up a webhook, you can add a webhook url in the Extend dashboard settings under the "Developer" tab. Once you have done this, you will start receiving events for workflow runs.

## Webhook event shape
| Field     | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| eventId   | **string** - Unique identifier for the event                                                                                                                    |
| eventType | **string** - Type of the event that occurred (workflow_run.completed)                                                                                           |
| payload   | **object** - Contains the WorkflowRun object. See the [GET WorkflowRun endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/get_workflow_run) for the shape.                       |

Here is what you can expect for a given incoming event:

```json Example Event
{
  "eventId": "event_1234",
  "eventType": "workflow_run.completed",
  "payload": {
    "object": "workflow_run",
    "id": "workflow_run_1234"
    // etc.
  }
}
```

## Event types

The following table outlines the various event types you can receive via webhooks:

| Event Type                | Description                                     |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| workflow_run.completed    | Triggered whenever a WorkflowRun is completed   |
| workflow_run.failed       | Triggered whenever a WorkflowRun fails          |
| workflow_run.needs_review | Triggered whenever a WorkflowRun needs review\* |

\* Only triggered when the workflow is configured to have a HumanReview step in the Extend workflow builder.
