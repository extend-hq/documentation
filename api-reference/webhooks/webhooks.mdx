## Authenticating webhooks

To authenticate an incoming webhook event you can check the `Extend-Signature` header on the request and match it against the webhook secret
available in your Extend dashboard settings. If the `Extend-Signature` header value does not match your secret, you should toss out the incoming event.

## The webhook event

### Fields

| Field | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| eventId | **string** - Unique identifier for the event |
| eventType | **string** - Type of the event that occurred (workflow_run.completed) |
| payload | **object** - Contains the data related to the event. In this case, it includes the properties of a completed workflow run from the IPublicWorkflowRun interface |

Here is what you can expect for a given incoming event:

```json Event
{
  "eventId": "event_jfdkfjsek",
  "eventType": "e.g. workflow.created, workflow_run.completed",
  "payload": {
    "object": "workflow_run",
    "id": "wr_fhdsjkfd"
    // etc.
  }
}
```


## List of all event types

The following table outlines the various event types you can receive via webhooks:

| Event Type | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| workflow_run.completed| Triggered whenever a WorkflowRun is completed |
| workflow.created | Triggered whenever a new Workflow is created |

## Example: `workflow_run.completed`

Once a workflow run is completed, if your workflow is configured to send a webhook, a `workflow_run.completed` event
will be pushed to your system, assuming you have defined a webhook url in your dashboard. Please reach out if you require any help 
getting set up.

# Output Types

**Note**: The output objects shown in the payload above will conform to the following schema, and the field keys are defined when configuring the extractor/classifer
in your worklfow builder:

```typescript Output types

/* The output type when type=EXTRACT */
export interface ExtractionOutput {
  [key: string]: ExtractFieldResult;
}

export interface ExtractionFieldResult {
  value: string;
  confidence: number;
  type: 
    | "string"
    | "number"
    | "currency"
    | "boolean"
    | "date"
    | "array"
    | "null";
  arrayJSONSchema?: string // Only set when type=array
}

/* The output type when type=CLASSIFY */
export type ClassificationOutput = {
  type: string;
  confidence: number;
};

export type Classification = {
  type: string;
  description: string;
};

```
