The Extend Sandbox has support for Slack in a limited way. For each File that is sent through a Workflow, if the File needs to be reviewed manually, a Slack
message can be configured to output the review URL.

Example Slack Message:
```
File sent to manual review

File Name: example_file_name.pdf
Uploaded At: 2023-01-01
Uploaded By: test@test.com
Go to this URL to review the fields and send any corrections.
```

To set up the Slack integration, please reach out to an Extend team member. In the Sandbox, only one Slack integration is allowed per team.
