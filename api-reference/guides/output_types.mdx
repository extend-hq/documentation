When running workflows, the overall payload output will conform to the shape described in the [webhook documentation](/api-reference/webhooks/webhooks#example-workflow-run-completed),
however the sub list of `workflow_run.outputs` is dynamic based on the type of AI processor.

The output shape for each AI processor are described in the types below.

```typescript Output types
/* The output type when type=EXTRACT */
type ExtractionOutput {
  [key: string]: ExtractionFieldResult;
}

type ExtractionFieldResult {
  id: string;
  value: string;
  confidence: number;
  type:
    | "string"
    | "number"
    | "currency"
    | "boolean"
    | "date"
    | "array"
    | "object"
    | "null";
  /**
   * Only set when type=array or type=object to provide structure of sub fields.
   * Useful for dynamically parsing nested data.
   */
  schema?: ExtractionFieldInput[];
}

type ExtractionFieldResultReference = {
  /*
   * The field id. When nested for arrays, this is the index of the row number
   */
  id: string;
  /*
   * The field name
   */
  fieldName: string;

  /**
   * The page number (starting at 1) that this bounding box is from 
   */
  page: number;

  /**
   * Array of bounding box references for this field.
   * There can be multiple is the extraction result was drawn from multiple distinct sources on the page.
   */
  boundingBoxes: BoundingBox[];
};

/**
 * See the Bounding Box guide for information on how to use/interpret this data
 */
type BoundingBox = {
  /**
   * The left most position of the bounding box
   */
  left: number;

  /**
   * The right most position of the bounding box
   */
  right: number;
  /**

   */

};

/* The output type when type=CLASSIFY */
type ClassificationOutput = {
  type: string;
  confidence: number;
};

type Classification = {
  type: string;
  description: string;
};

type ClassificationConfig = {
  classifications: Classification[];
}

/* The output type when type=INSTRUCT_QA */
export type InstructionQAOutput = {
  answer: InstructionQAAnswer;
  notes: string[];
  confidence: number;
  references: PageReference[];
};

/**
 * Note: subset of ExtractionReference. Bounding box is not yet supported for INSTRUCT_QA, but will be in the future.
