## What are Base Processors?

Base processors are the fundamental building blocks of our processing system. They control the underlying, base configuration for each processor, encompassing various critical components:

- Foundation model(s) used
- The OCR models applied in pre-processing
- Other pre-processing methods used to clean and prepare data for the LLM
- Post-processing rules
- Internal validation schemes
- Multimodal vs. non-multimodal processing
- Base prompting strategies
- And other core functionalities surrounding the execution of a given processor

These base configurations are essential in determining the overall performance, accuracy, and capabilities of our processing system across different use cases.

## Versioning System

We employ a semantic versioning system for our base processors. This system allows us to communicate the nature and impact of changes clearly. Our version numbers follow the format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

### Major Version Updates (X.0.0)

Major version updates are reserved for changes that can potentially affect accuracy, latency, or reliability across every use case. The expectation is that 
a major version update would guaranteed impact all users of the processor, and any consumer should expect to see changes in their output when upgrading to a new major version.

These include changes such as:

- Updates to the underlying model and downstream version
  - We generally avoid upgrading to new models at the base layer unless there's a significant, across-the-board benefit. Use case specific upgrades might still occur in an override fashion for your use case (which would be communicated separately).
- Changes to the entire structure of our base prompting system
- Fundamental changes to how a given processor works/or is configured
- Modifications that affect how data interacts with consumers of the API
- etc.

### Minor Version Updates (0.X.0)

Minor version updates are for changes that could cause potentially significant changes to specific use cases, but not necessarily all use cases. 

Examples include:
- Adding a new field type for extraction, e.g. the `signature` type or `enum` type
- Introducing a new set of base prompt rule for specific data types to improve accuracy
- Making backwards compatible, but still material changes to the underlying processor model
- etc.

### Patch Version Updates (0.0.X)

Patch updates are for changes that are not expected to meaningfully impact functionality in any way outside of very few isolated cases. 

These might include:
- Addressing a bug in the processor that only affects a small subset of use cases
- Fixing typos in prompts
- Adjusting newlines or spacing in prompts
- etc.

## Importance of Versioning

Understanding our versioning system is crucial for developers and users of our base processors. It allows you to:

1. Anticipate the potential impact of updates on your specific use cases
2. Make informed decisions about when to upgrade to newer versions
3. Maintain consistency and reliability in your applications that depend on our base processors

We strive to provide detailed changelogs for each version update, ensuring you have all the information needed to understand the changes and their potential impacts on your workflows.
